I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] in order to have important =.dot= files, usually located in separate directories in the filesystem, version controlled in =git= from a designated repository.
Easier to use a tool like this than to do it manually.

** Steps required
- Create a designated ='stow'= directory, e.g. =~/.dotfiles=.
- Recreate the directory structure for the files you want to manage as subdir(s) of that directory.

  e.g. to have my [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom emacs]] config files managed by =stow= and they have been installed to =~/.config/doom/=, i would do the following:
#+begin_src bash :noeval
# N.B. directory structure
mkdir -p ~/.dotfiles/doom/.config/doom
mv ~/.config/doom ~/.dotfiles/doom/config/
cd ~/.dotfiles
# finally, invoke stow
stow doom
#+end_src

Now, listing the initial config directory should show a symlink pointing to new location:
#+begin_src bash :noeval
ls -al ~/.config
doom -> ../.dotfiles/doom/.config/doom
#+end_src

Initialize a git repository in =~/.dotfiles=, commit and push to remote and your done.
